# Where Is My Data Stored?

Chatbox places high importance on your data privacy and security. When using the Chatbox application, all your chat messages and settings data are stored on your device. Chatbox will not upload any of your data to any server without your permission.

When you use the Chatbox AI model service (the recommended method) in the Chatbox application, the messages you send to the AI, along with some context and any images or files you upload, will be transmitted to the Chatbox AI service to generate AI responses. The Chatbox AI service only uses the data you send to generate AI responses, and your data may be temporarily stored on Chatbox AI servers to speed up responses for subsequent queries. Chatbox AI does not permanently store your data, nor use it for any other purposes, including but not limited to advertising, model training, or any other commercial use.

In addition to using Chatbox AI model services, when you use third-party API services to run other models in the Chatbox application, we cannot guarantee the privacy and security of your data. You need to review the privacy policies and terms of service of these third-party model services to understand how your data may be used. If you prioritize privacy and security, please consider choosing Chatbox AI services.
