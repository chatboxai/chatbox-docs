## Pricing Plans

**What's the difference between Chatbox AI Plan and using your own API KEY?**

Compared to using your own API KEY, Chatbox AI service is more convenient, stable, fast, and user-friendly. You can also use your own API KEY in Chatbox to access AI models. When using your own API KEY, you need to handle network connectivity, account maintenance, and other common technical challenges yourself. The Chatbox client cannot guarantee the quality of API online services, including service stability, response speed, and performance.

Chatbox AI service eliminates these concerns. Chatbox AI provides an out-of-the-box, easily accessible, high-speed, and stable online service. You only need to pay backend costs at cost price to enjoy the efficiency improvements brought by AI technology.
