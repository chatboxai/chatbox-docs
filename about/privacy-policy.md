### Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2023-08-29

Chatbox ("we", "us", "our") operates the Chatbox application ("Service"). We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users ("you"). This Privacy Policy outlines our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of the Service.

By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This policy is incorporated into our Terms of Service, which also apply when you use our Service.

#### Collection and Use of Personal Information

We do not collect any personal data that could be used to identify you unless it is specifically and knowingly provided by you. Chatbox is primarily a client application that stores all personal chat data directly on your device, ensuring your privacy and control over your conversations.

The Service is designed to avoid the collection or retention of sensitive personal data. Chatbox will not collect or store any chat logs on our servers. The only time the Service may handle personal data is when:

* 1\. A user opts to use the Chatbox AI online service, in which case the current conversation's messages are transmitted to our servers solely for the purpose of generating AI responses. These messages are processed in real-time and are not stored on our servers after the AI response is generated.
* 2\. A user subscribes to the Chatbox AI subscription service. We only collect necessary information such as email addresses, billing addresses, or payment details through our associated sales platform, Lemonsqueezy. These details are used exclusively for processing subscriptions and providing customer support.

We may also collect non-personally identifiable information that your device provides in the normal course of interacting with our Service, such as device type, operating system, and application configurations, known as Log Data. This Log Data may include details like your IP address to help diagnose issues with our service, administer the Service, and analyze trends.

#### Use of Third-Party Services

Our Service may use third-party tools and services to assist in analytics, service optimization, or for technical support. These may include:

* [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/)
* [Sentry](https://sentry.io/privacy/)
* [Lemonsqueezy](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/privacy)

These third-party services have their own Privacy Policies, which we recommend you review.

#### Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Chatbox does not directly use cookies. However, some third-party services we utilize may use cookies or similar tracking technologies to monitor interactions with our Service. You have the option to either accept or decline these cookies and should refer to your browser settings for managing your preferences.

#### Security

The security of your Personal Information is important to us. We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, but no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure. While we cannot guarantee absolute security, we are dedicated to protecting your information.

#### Links to Other Websites

The Service may contain links to other websites not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you'll be directed to that website. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit as we have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content or privacy practices of any third-party sites.

#### Children's Privacy

Our Service does not target and is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from a child without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.

#### Privacy Policy Updates

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when posted on this page. We will notify users of any changes by updating the information on this page and through the Service.

#### Contact Information

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at hi@chatboxai.com.

By using Chatbox, you consent to this Privacy Policy.
